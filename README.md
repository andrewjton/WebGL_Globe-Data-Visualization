##Changes in Power Consumption by Country in the Early 21st century

Deployed here:

The purpose of the project was to compare the differences in energy consumption in different societies worldwide and then visualize how that changed in the early 21st century. My globe displays the electrical power consumption by country between 2005 and 2013. Units are in billions of Kilowatt hours. This project primarily relied on the WebGL Globe Javascript library, and was deployed via a custom LAMP stack that I set up. Secondary languages used were python, HTML, and CSS for formatting the data and styling the page. 

Key Trends Discovered:

* China's growing appetite for energy
* US and China are orders of magnitude ahead of the world in terms of power consumption. This is probably because of the developed industrial and manafacturing sectors.
* Developing countries such as Brazil, China, and India have made strides in energy consumption while other countries have held constant.
* No country significantly decreased their energy consumption.
